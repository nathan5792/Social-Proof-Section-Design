## My process
-Started by setting up the basic HTML structure with semantic elements.
-Styled the layout using CSS Flex-box and CSS-Grid for alignment and responsiveness.
-Used media queries to ensure the card-Section looks good on both mobile and desktop screens including tablets and mini ipads.
-Tested the design in different screen sizes to fine-tune responsiveness.


### Built with

-Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS3 custom properties
-Flexbox and CSS-Grid for layout
-Responsive design techniques

### What I learned
-How to structure a clean and re-usable card-Section component with multiple sections.
-Improved my understanding of responsive layouts with Flexbox, CSS-Grid and media queries.
-Learned how to better manage spacing, typography, and alignment for pixel-perfect results.
-Gained experience in replicating real-world designs more accurately.
-This was by far the challenging one i have come across and have learned alot different from the others such as playing around with positions and padddings and margins, this challenge has definetely helped me to level up my skills generally.
